# Ansible-VM-Health-Reporter-
This project automates daily extraction of VM metrics. It provisions 1 Master Node and 5 Control Nodes on AWS Ubuntu VMs. Passwordless authentication is set up using the .pem key to establish a Masterâ€“Control node setup. A dynamic inventory is created using the IP addresses of the Control Nodes to streamline metric collection.
